# FE method to generate RVEs of composites with various type of incluions

## Method
Here we present a multi-step dynamic FE compression method to generate RVEs of composites with various inclusions and high inclusion vomume fractions. The method is implemented via four sequential steps:  
1. Within the initial region of specific dimensions (i.e., larger than the targeted RVE), sparse and periodic inclusions exhibiting a predefined orientation distribution are generated by implementing the modified RSA algorithm and the sparse inclusions are required to be completely contained in the region.
2. The sparse inclusions are compressed into the region of the targeted RVE through a dynamic FE analysis.
3. The periodic inclusions are subsequently compressed into the region of the targeted RVE by utilizing a dynamic FE analysis with periodic boundary conditions.
4. Postprocessing procedures are executed to ascertain the positions and orientations of the compressed inclusions, facilitating generation of the CAD-format RVE of composites.

## Implementation

- The matlab codes in **RSA_Codes_2D** are used for generating circumcenters and predefined orientation angles of inclusions.
- The python codes in **FE_Compression_Method** are used for generating the packed inclusions on the baisi of Abaqus.
  - Implementation: Explicit_Compression_Abaqus_2D_Single_S1 -> Job-1 FE analyis -> PostProcessing_ExtractCentroidsOriAngles_2D_S1 -> FileCombination -> Explicit_Compression_Abaqus_2D_Single_S2 -> Job-2 FE analyis -> PostProcessing_ExtractCentroidsOriAngles_2D_S2 -> RVE_2D_Generation_Single.
- The python codes in **Statistical_Analysis** are used for statistically analyzing distribution of the packed inclusions.
- The python codes in **FEH_Elastic_Prediction** and **FEH_Damage_Modeling** are used for predicting of the elastic properties and damage behaviors of the acquired RVEs.
